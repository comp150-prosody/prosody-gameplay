This project is a group submission for the final project in COMP150-DR Developmental Robotics

The members of the group are Eric Chen, Matt Shenton, and Avi Block.

Once the compressed folders have been unzipped, this process can be executed according to the following steps:

1 - Alter audio_recorder.py program to direct audio output to a .wav file in an accessible location
2 - Alter TamerRLagent to the right path to the emotions file in the ReadKeyboardInput function
3 - open TamerProject in eclipse
4 - Run DxMountCarTamerRL as a java applet
5 - run audio_recorder.py from terminal
6 - Press space to put mountain car in training mode, record audio, press L after each utterance to make mountain car check updated emotions file

Thanks!
